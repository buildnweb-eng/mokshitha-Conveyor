# About Page Redesign Suggestions

## Mokshitha Industrial Automation Website

This document outlines recommended improvements to enhance the About page based on analysis of manufacturing/industrial B2B websites and About page best practices.

---

## Current State Analysis

The About page currently has **4 sections**:

| # | Section | Content |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | Hero | Simple heading "About Mokshitha" + subtitle "Leading the industry since 2013" |
| 2 | Company Overview | 2-column: Facility image + "Who We Are" text (3 paragraphs) |
| 3 | Core Values | 4 value cards (Mission, Expert Team, Quality First, Continuous Growth) |
| 4 | Capabilities | 3 capability cards (Manufacturing Excellence, Engineering Solutions, Quality Assurance) |

**Current Issues Identified:**d
- No Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons throughout the page
- No team/leadership information despite mentioning "Expert Team"
- No company timeline or milestones (only mentions 2013 founding)
- No statistics/metrics integration (500+ clients, 1000+ projects, etc.)
- No certifications display (ISO, partnerships)
- No testimonials or social proof
- No video content or multimedia
- Limited visual engagement compared to redesigned home page
- No FAQ section for common company questions
- Missing final CTA to drive conversions
